                                                Credit card fraud is a crime, and the Website Operator will do everything in its power to help local and international agents to trace people committing such felonies. The Website Operator will NOT pay any fees in case of fraudulent purchases. The purchases MUST originate from the owner of the credit card or have permission from the owner for using their credit card.
